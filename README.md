<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle Example</h1>

<p>In this lab, I demonstrate how to manage the ticket lifecycle in osTicket. This example simulates end-user ticket creation, assignment to help desk agents, and resolution, focusing on ticket properties, SLAs, and working tickets to completion.</p>

<h2>Ticket Lifecycle Management Steps</h2>

</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Admin/Analyst Login</strong>: I started by accessing the osTicket Admin Panel via <a href="http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php">http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php</a>. The end-user osTicket URL is <a href="http://localhost/osTicket/open.php">http://localhost/osTicket</a>. For this lab, I simulated ticket creation as an end-user and worked on those tickets as a help desk agent.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Create a Ticket as an End User</strong>: I created a ticket as an end-user reporting that the entire mobile/online banking system was down. Then, as the help desk agent (Pablo), I observed the ticket’s properties, including Priority, Department, SLA, and Assigned To.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Set Ticket Properties</strong>: As the help desk agent (Pablo), I set the ticket properties as follows: SLA - Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7), Help Topic - Report a Problem / Business Critical Outage, and I assigned the ticket to the Online Banking Team. Then, as David (a member of the Online Banking Team and SysAdmin), I worked the ticket to completion.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Create Another Ticket</strong>: I created another ticket as an end-user, stating that the accounting department needed an Adobe upgrade. As Pablo, the help desk agent, I observed the ticket properties, set the SLA to Sev-C (8 hours, business hours), and assigned the ticket to the Support department. I then worked the ticket to completion as John.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Create a Third Ticket</strong>: As an end-user, I created a third ticket reporting that the CFO’s laptop would no longer turn on. As the help desk agent (John), I observed the ticket properties, set the SLA to Sev-C (8 hours, business hours), and assigned the ticket to the Support department. I then worked the ticket to completion as John.</p>

</p>

<p><strong></strong> In this lab, I learned how to create tickets, assign SLAs, departments, and teams, and manage ticket escalations. This practice helps improve workflow and ticket management skills in real-world help desk scenarios.</p>
