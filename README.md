</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Create a Ticket as an End User</strong>: As an end-user, create a ticket stating that the entire mobile/online banking system is down. As a help desk agent (Pablo), observe the ticket’s properties such as Priority, Department, SLA, and Assigned To.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Set Ticket Properties</strong>: As the help desk agent (Pablo), set the ticket properties as follows: SLA - Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7); change the help topic to Report a Problem / Business Critical Outage, and assign the ticket to the Online Banking Team. Then, work the ticket to completion as David (Online Banking Team member and SysAdmin).</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Create Another Ticket</strong>: As an end-user, create another ticket stating that the accounting department needs an Adobe upgrade. As a help desk agent (Pablo), observe the ticket’s properties. Set the SLA to Sev-C (8 hours, business hours) and assign the ticket to the Support department. Work the ticket to completion as John.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Create a Third Ticket</strong>: As an end-user, create a third ticket stating that the CFO’s laptop will no longer turn on. As a help desk agent (John), observe the ticket’s properties. Set the SLA to Sev-C (8 hours, business hours) and assign the ticket to the Support department. Work the ticket to completion as John.</p>
